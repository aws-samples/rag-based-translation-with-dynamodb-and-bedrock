And other characters have specific artifacts that I won t change unless I need to raise ER or CRIT. So please someone advise me.

    ('Should ‚ÄúAventurine‚Äù be ‚ÄúKakavasha‚Äù?\nSPOILERS for 2.1!!!\xa0Just a random thought - is Aventurine still ‚ÄúAventurine‚Äù after the ending of 2.1? Isn‚Äôt the aventurine stone destroyed, and his connection to it severed by Acheron? Plus it really seems like a lot of IPC employees are slaves (‚Äúforced employment‚Äù), definitely true for Topaz and Aventurine, so shouldn‚Äôt that name be abandoned if they‚Äôre freed/escape? I interpreted the discussion with Acheron as him being freed from both the IPC‚Äôs power and Sunday‚Äôs curse, and now finding himself a free man, with a future for himself to decide. (Providing he can survive the real dreamscape, but I‚Äôm fairly confident we can side with Ratio on this one. Do live, gambler - we‚Äôre betting on you!)\xa0Basically this boils down to wondering if we should call him Kakavasha out of respect? I guess we need to wait and see? Perhaps Aventurine himself sees Kakavasha as dead, so he might not want to use that name either. Not out of hatred or lack of love for his childhood, but the opposite actually. Maybe he feels too changed from Kakavasha to reclaim his birth name? ', 'EN', 'RU'),

2. The official organizer will assess the strategy guides that meet the criteria on the basis of various factors, such as their timely effectiveness, completeness, content accuracy, clarity of explanation, applicability, composition, and aesthetics of the layout. Therefore, it is possible that not all awards will be given out.

3. If a prize-winning entry is disqualified due to violation of contest rules, the official team will not select a substitute winner.
